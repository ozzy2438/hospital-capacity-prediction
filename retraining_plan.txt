MODEL RETRAINING PLAN
=====================

RECOMMENDED SCHEDULE: Quarterly (Every 3 months)

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
- Q1 2025 retrain is DUE NOW (March 2025)
- Feature drift detected: flu beds (-61%), temperature (+89%)

RETRAINING TRIGGERS:
1. Performance: AUC drops >5% from baseline (0.96 -> 0.91)
2. Feature Drift: Any feature shifts >30% from training mean
3. Data Volume: New data >20% of training set
4. Seasonal: Every 3 months
5. Manual: Policy/operational changes

MONITORING METRICS:
- Weekly: Check AUC on rolling 30-day window
- Monthly: Feature distribution comparison
- Quarterly: Full model retrain + validation

ROLLBACK CRITERIA:
- New model AUC <0.94
- Precision drops >10%
- Feature importance shifts dramatically
